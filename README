Welcome the HX1-Mod project, a repository to share modifications
I made for my SeeMeCNC H1 (http://seemecnc.com)

The first goal of this project is to design a new X-Carriage that
can hold different hotends aiming the Budaschnozzle hotend from
LuzBot at first (http://reprap.org/wiki/LulzBot/Budaschnozzle),
one of the best hotend available for our 3D printers, while keeping
the original Steve's Extruder and the H1 bearing supports.
In the future, I'll post updates to use LM6UU linear bearing
(you'll need to update your H1 smooth rods first to 6mm).
